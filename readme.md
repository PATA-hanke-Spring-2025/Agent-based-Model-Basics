To Run:
Right-click app.py in VSCode, click "Run in Interactive Window", click "Run Current File in Interactive Window"

Current Issues:

No limit for percentages. It can go over 1 which makes the code freak out. I don't have the energy to figure out a limiter right now, so I'll do it later.

Page refreshes each time the slider is moved. It's not a crucial problem but annoying when using the program.

No slider for how many steps the program will take.

No seller agent.

I'm not even gonna start on the UI.


If you don't count these issues, it's a fully working agent model.
