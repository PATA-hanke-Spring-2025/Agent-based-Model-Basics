# Simulating B2B Buyer-Seller Interactions with Value-Based Decision Logicâ€‹

This project goal is to simulate B2B buyer-seller interactions using an agent-based model that incorporates value-based decision logic. 

## Description

 The simulation allows users to model and analyze the dynamics of decision-making processes between buyers and sellers in a business-to-business context. It leverages state transition matrices, value elements, and category weights, incorporating industry types, participant knowledge, and selected strategies to simulate realistic interactions. The system is modular and designed for flexibility, allowing exploration of diverse scenarios and datasets.

## Getting Started

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- openpyxl: For reading and writing .xlsx Excel files.
- xlrd: For reading .xls Excel files.
- matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
- seaborn: For advanced data visualization.
- importlib: For dynamically importing modules (built into Python, no need to install).
